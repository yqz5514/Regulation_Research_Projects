PAL  A flexible disk file signal storage apparatus has a multiplicity of
      relatively thin, flexible disks of varying radii and arranged axially to
      facilitate radial disk selection. The radii pattern tends to minimize
      radii differences, thereby enhancing storage capacity. The flexible disks
      are arranged in axial groups of more than three disks with at least one
      disk in each group having a minimum radius with a pair of outer disks with
      a maximum radius plus at least one intermediate diameter disk. By
      interleaving alternate ones of said minimum radius disks between
      intermediate and maximum radius disks, radial selection access ports are
      maximized along an axial direction for a given radial difference between
      the maximum and minimum disk radii.

PAC  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
PAR  This invention relates to rotating magnetic memories.
PAR  Rotating magnetic members used as storage media are well known in the form
      of magnetic drums, magnetic disks, magnetic strips, and flexible magnetic
      disks. The latter category of rotating magnetic memories offers enhanced
      volumetric efficiency in the storage of signals; that is, the number of
      disks stored in a given volumetric unit appears to be a maximal when used
      with such flexible magnetic disks. Such flexible magnetic disks preferably
      have a relatively thin, axial dimension in the order of magnitude from
      0.0010, or 0.005 inch. It is also preferred, for stabilization purposes,
      that such disks be axially spaced apart a small distance, such as one-half
      mil to ten mils, with radial air flow being circumferentially uniformly
      distributed for stabilizing the individual disks during rotation.

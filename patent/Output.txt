RE: Stop Mercury and Air Toxics Now (EPA Docket U EPA-HQ-OAR-2009..0234) 
Dear Administrator Lisa Jackson: 
On behalf of the Catholic Health Association of the United States (CHA), the national leadership 
organization of the Catholic health ministry representing the largest group of not-for-profit health care 
providers in the nation, I want to congratulate you on proposing Clean Air Act standards to protect our 
nation's communities from the threats of toxic air pollution from power plants. 
There is growing evidence that power plants emit some of the most hazardous air pollutants known to 
us. These pollutants are the source of a number of extreme health problems —particularly in children 
and the unborn, the poor and the elderly. These health problems include brain damage, learning 
disabilities, birth defects, heart disease, cancer, bronchitis, asthma and other crippling and life-
threatening conditions. 
Our position on controlling pollution from power plants is rooted in the Catholic Church's teachings on 
the dignity of the human person and the sanctity of human life—especially in regards to the poor and 
vulnerable who disproportionately bear the brunt of environmental degradation As a ministry of the 
church, we are committed to protect and defend the life, health and dignity of every human person. 
Our position is also grounded in the Judeo-Chrjstian call to "cultivate and care for" God's good gift of 
Creation (Gn 2:15). 
We encourage the EPA to adopt strong air quality policies in order to protect the health and welfare of 
both people and the planet, and we oppose industry and Congressional pressure to weaken the 
proposed rules. 
For additional informjtion on CHA's position, please contact Julie Trocchio at Jtrocchio@chausa org or 202 721 6320.
